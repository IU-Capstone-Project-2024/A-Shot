# Welcome to A-Shot

A-Shot is a user-friendly, multiplatform tool that leverages computer vision
and machine learning to simplify and accelerate the photo culling process for photographers.
Within the given timeframe of several weeks,
we will focus on the development of the following essential features:

1. **Blur detection:**
   To automatically identify and eliminate low-quality, blurry shots.

2. **Exposure imbalance detection:**
   To detect and remove images with poor exposure,
   ensuring that only the best-exposed shots are presented for selection.

3. **Grouping of similar shots:**
   To automatically group similar images together,
   making it easy to compare and choose the best shot from each group.

To make it easier to track changes and identify bugs, we ask that you commit your changes regularly. Ideally, you
should be committing your changes at least once a day.

### 3. Create a separate branch for new features.
